A simple Java console application to calculate and display student grades based on marks entered by the user.

## 📌 Overview

This project helps calculate the grade of a student based on the marks entered.  
It uses a simple grading logic (for example: A for marks >= 90, B for 80–89, etc.).  
The program outputs the calculated grade along with the student’s total and average marks.

## ✨ Features

✅ Input student name and marks for different subjects  
✅ Calculate total and average marks  
✅ Assign grades based on average  
✅ Simple and user-friendly console interface

## 🧩 How It Works (Logic)

- Prompt the user to enter:
  - Student's name
  - Marks for each subject
- Calculate:
  - Total marks = sum of all subject marks
  - Average = total marks / number of subjects
- Determine grade:
  - Average >= 90 → Grade A
  - Average >= 80 → Grade B
  - Average >= 70 → Grade C
  - Average >= 60 → Grade D
  - Else → Grade F
- Display the results.

> Note: The grading scheme can be customized.
